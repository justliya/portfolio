## Introduction

Job searching in 2025 is a numbers game. The average job seeker applies to dozens, if not hundreds, of positions before landing an interview. Each application requires tailoring your resume, researching the company, and crafting personalized cover letters. What if AI could handle the heavy lifting?

Together with my partner [La'Kaleigh Harris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/la-kaleigh-harris-01/), we set out to build a comprehensive AI-powered job search assistant that would automate the entire job hunting process - from discovering opportunities to tailoring resumes for each application.

This post details our journey implementing one of the first production systems using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Google's A2A protocol, showcasing how modern multi-agent architectures can solve complex, real-world problems.

## The Partnership

Our collaboration brought together complementary expertise:
- **La'Kaleigh Harris** designed and developed the sophisticated resume tailoring agent - a seven-stage pipeline that transforms generic resumes into targeted, ATS-optimized documents
- **I (Aaliyah Johnson)** built the job search infrastructure, company research capabilities, and engineered the agent architecture using the A2A protocol

## The Problem We're Solving

Modern job seekers face several challenges:
- **Information Overload**: Searching across multiple job boards is time-consuming
- **Resume Customization**: Each application needs a tailored resume highlighting relevant skills
- **Company Research**: Understanding company culture, salaries, and interview processes takes hours
- **Application Tracking**: Managing dozens of applications becomes overwhelming

Our AI assistant tackles these challenges by creating an intelligent, automated pipeline that handles everything from job discovery to application preparation.

## Architecture Overview

The system is built on a microservices architecture with AI agents at its core:

\`\`\`
Frontend (React/TypeScript) → FastAPI Server → Agent Orchestration → External Services
\`\`\`

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Google ADK
- **AI Models**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Storage**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- **APIs**: JSearch, Glassdoor (via MCP)
- **Document Processing**: python-docx, PyPDF2
- **Deployment**: Docker, Cloud Run

### Key Components:

1. **FastAPI Server**: Handles HTTP requests with CORS support for web clients
2. **Google ADK Framework**: Powers the AI agent orchestration
3. **Coordinator Agent**: Routes requests to specialized sub-agents
4. **Job Search Pipeline**: Three specialized agents working in sequence
5. **Resume Pipeline**: Seven-stage resume optimization process
6. **External Integrations**: Firebase, job APIs, and document processing

## The Agent Architecture

### Coordinator Agent
The brain of our system, built with Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model:

\`\`\`python
coordinator = Agent(
    name="coordinator_agent",
    description="Orchestrates job search and resume tailoring workflows",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
    instruction="Route requests to appropriate sub-agents based on user intent",
    sub_agents=[jobsearch_pipeline, resume]
)
\`\`\`

### Job Search Pipeline
A sequential agent that executes three specialized sub-agents:

1. **Profile Agent**: Fetches user preferences from Firebase
   - Connects to Firebase using MCP (Model Context Protocol)
   - Retrieves saved job preferences, skills, and target roles
   - No user interaction required - fully automated

2. **Listing Search Agent**: Discovers relevant job opportunities
   - Integrates with JSearch and Glassdoor APIs
   - Filters based on location, salary, experience level
   - Returns structured job data with direct application links

3. **Company Research Agent**: Provides deep company intelligence
   - Analyzes company culture through employee reviews
   - Gathers salary data and interview insights
   - Generates comprehensive reports for each company

### Resume Tailoring Pipeline
Seven specialized agents work together to optimize resumes:

\`\`\`python
resume_pipeline = SequentialAgent(
    name='ResumeTailorAgent',
    sub_agents=[
        base_resume_cleanup,      # Extract and clean resume content
        job_optimization_agent,   # Align with job requirements
        experience_optimization,  # Highlight relevant experience
        ats_optimization,        # Optimize for ATS systems
        humanize_resume,         # Make it engaging
        proof_reader,           # Fix errors
        doc_creator             # Generate formatted document
    ]
)
\`\`\`

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

The system exposes two main endpoints:

\`\`\`python
@app.post("/run-job-search")
async def run_job_search(request: JobSearchRequest):
    """Complete job search workflow for a user"""
    # 1. Fetch preferences
    # 2. Search for jobs
    # 3. Research companies
    # Return structured results

@app.post("/tailor-resume") 
async def tailor_resume(request: ResumeTailorRequest):
    """Optimize resume for specific job description"""
    # 1. Parse existing resume
    # 2. Run through 7-stage pipeline
    # 3. Generate formatted document
    # Return optimized resume + download URL
\`\`\`

### Session Management

We use Google ADK's session service to maintain state across agent interactions:

\`\`\`python
self.session_service = InMemorySessionService()
self.runner = Runner(
    agent=self.agent,
    app_name="job_search_assistant",
    session_service=self.session_service
)
\`\`\`

### Document Processing

The system handles multiple document formats:
- **Input**: PDF, DOCX, TXT files from Firebase Storage
- **Processing**: Extract text, parse sections, identify key information
- **Output**: Professionally formatted DOCX using templates

## Real-World Example

Here's how a typical job search flow works:

1. **User Request**: "Find me software engineering jobs"
2. **Profile Agent**: Retrieves user's saved preferences (Python, 5 years exp, $120k+)
3. **Listing Agent**: Finds 5 matching positions from multiple sources
4. **Research Agent**: Analyzes each company, providing:
   - Overall rating: 4.2/5
   - CEO approval: 87%
   - Interview difficulty: Medium
   - Salary range: $110k-$150k
   - Common interview questions
5. **Results**: Structured JSON with actionable insights

## Why A2A Was Perfect for Our Use Case

The A2A protocol, introduced by Google provides a standardized way for AI agents to communicate and collaborate. As outlined in the protocol specification:

> "A2A defines a client–server interaction model for agents. One agent plays the client (requester) role, formulating a task and sending it to another agent playing the remote (executor) role. All communication uses familiar web protocols – HTTP(S) as the transport, with requests encoded in JSON and following a JSON-RPC 2.0 schema."

## Our A2A Implementation

### 1. Agent Discovery and Registration

Following A2A's specification, our root agent publishes an Agent Card at \`/.well-known/agent.json\`:

\`\`\`python
agent_metadata = {
    "name": name,
    "description": description,
    "endpoints": ["run-job-search", "tailor-resume"],
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "capabilities": ["job_search", "profile_analysis", "company_research", "resume_tailoring"],
    "sub_agents": [
        "profile_agent",
        "listing_search_agent", 
        "company_research_agent",
        "resume_agent",
    ],
}
\`\`\`

This allows agents to dynamically discover each other's capabilities without hard-coding integrations.

###  Task-Based Communication

We leveraged A2A's task-oriented messaging model. When a user initiates a job search, the Coordinator Agent creates a task that flows through our agent pipeline:

\`\`\`python
# Coordinator routes to job search pipeline
jobsearch_pipeline = SequentialAgent(
    name="job_search_ai_assistant",
    description="execute a sequence of profile_agent, listing_search, and company_research",
    sub_agents=[profile_preferences, listing_search_agent, company_research]
)

# Or routes to resume agent for tailoring
coordinator = Agent(
    name="coordinator_agent",
    description="Orchestrates job search and resume tailoring workflows",
    instruction="Route requests to appropriate sub-agent based on user intent",
    sub_agents=[jobsearch_pipeline, resume],
)
\`\`\`

###  Asynchronous Processing with SSE

A2A's support for Server-Sent Events (SSE) was crucial for our long-running operations. Job searches and resume tailoring can take minutes, so we implemented streaming updates:

\`\`\`python
async for event in runner.run_async(
    user_id=user_id, 
    session_id=session_id, 
    new_message=request_content
):
    # Stream progress updates to client
    if hasattr(event, 'state_update'):
        # Handle intermediate results
\`\`\`

###  Multi-Modal Content Exchange

La'Kaleigh's resume agent showcases A2A's multi-modal capabilities. It exchanges various content types:
- Text prompts and instructions
- PDF/DOCX resume files
- Formatted JSON job descriptions
- Generated Word documents

As A2A specifies:
> "Each message carries a role and one or more Parts which hold the content payload. A Part could be a block of text, a binary file, or structured data – each part is tagged with a content type (MIME type)."

## The Complete Workflow

Here's how our system leverages A2A to orchestrate a complete job search:

 **User Request**: "Find me software engineering jobs"
   - FastAPI endpoint receives request
   - Creates A2A task with user context

 **Profile Discovery** (via Firebase MCP):
   \`\`\`python
   tools = MCPToolset(
       connection_params=StdioServerParams(
           command="npx",
           args=["-y", "@gannonh/firebase-mcp"],
       ),
       tool_filter=["firestore_get_document", ...]
   )
   \`\`\`

 **Job Search Orchestration**:
   - Profile Agent retrieves preferences via A2A message
   - Listing Agent searches multiple platforms via A2A task delegation
   - Company Research Agent analyzes each opportunity
   - All communicate via standardized A2A messages

 **Resume Tailoring** (La'Kaleigh's domain):
   - Seven sequential agents collaborate via A2A
   - Each agent transforms the resume incrementally
   - Final agent generates professional Word document
   - Results returned via A2A artifacts

## Security and Enterprise Readiness

Following A2A's security guidelines, we implemented:

\`\`\`python
# CORS middleware for web clients
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:5173", "*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# Session-based authentication
session = await self.session_service.create_session(
    app_name=A2A_APP_NAME,
    user_id=user_id,
    session_id=session_id,
    state={}
)
\`\`\`

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Firebase Storage Access
**Problem**: Resume files uploaded with private permissions
**Solution**: Implemented signed URL generation and fallback mechanisms

\`\`\`python
def download_and_extract_resume_text(storage_url: str) -> str:
    # Try public URL first
    # Generate signed URL if needed
    # Handle multiple file formats
    # Graceful error handling
\`\`\`

### Challenge 2: Agent Coordination
**Problem**: Complex workflows with multiple sequential steps
**Solution**: Used Google ADK's SequentialAgent for automatic orchestration

### Challenge 3: Resume Parsing
**Problem**: Resumes come in various formats and structures
**Solution**: Built a comprehensive parser with regex patterns for each section

### Challenge 4: Long-Running Operations
**Problem**: Resume tailoring through 7 agents takes 2-3 minutes
**Solution**: Implemented A2A's async patterns with progress streaming

### Challenge 5: Agent Coordination Complexity
**Problem**: Managing state across multiple sequential agents
**Solution**: Leveraged A2A's built-in session management:

\`\`\`python
# A2A maintains state across agent interactions
final_session = await self.session_service.get_session(
    app_name=A2A_APP_NAME,
    user_id=user_id,
    session_id=session_id
)
# Each agent's output becomes available to the next
if 'job_listings' in final_session.state:
    job_listings = final_session.state['job_listings']
\`\`\`

## Integration with Existing Tools

One of A2A's strengths is its ability to integrate with existing frameworks. Our implementation demonstrates this:

### MCP + A2A Synergy
We used both Anthropic's MCP and Google's A2A protocols together:
- **MCP**: For tool access (Firebase, job search APIs)
- **A2A**: For agent-to-agent communication

\`\`\`python
# MCP for tool access
tools = MCPToolset(
    connection_params=StreamableHTTPServerParams(
        url=MCP_SERVER_URL,
    ),
    tool_filter=["search_jobs", "get_company_overview", ...]
)

# A2A for agent communication
agent_instance = Agent(
    name="listing_search_agent",
    tools=[toolset],  # MCP tools
    # Communicates with other agents via A2A
)
\`\`\`

### Framework Agnostic
While we used Google's ADK, the A2A protocol allowed us to potentially integrate agents built with other frameworks:
- LangChain agents could be wrapped with A2A interfaces
- Microsoft Semantic Kernel agents could join our ecosystem
- Custom Python functions became A2A-compliant agents

## Performance and Scalability

- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute timeout for complex operations
- **Async Processing**: All agent operations run asynchronously
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallbacks at each step
- **Caching**: Session-based caching reduces API calls

## Real-World Benefits We've Observed

   **Modularity**: When La'Kaleigh needed to update the resume optimization logic, she could do so without touching the job search components. A2A's standardized interface meant changes were isolated.

   **Scalability**: Each agent can be deployed and scaled independently. The resume agent might need more compute resources than the profile agent - A2A's distributed nature allows this flexibility.

   **Debugging**: A2A's structured task/message model made debugging much easier:
   \`\`\`python
   logger.info(f"Running job search for user: {user_id} with timeout: {self.timeout}s")
   # Track each agent's contribution
   logger.info("Received job listings update")
   logger.info("Received company research update")
   \`\`\`

   **Extensibility**: Adding new capabilities is straightforward. Want to add a cover letter generator? Create a new agent with an A2A interface and add it to the coordinator's sub-agents.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Design for Asynchrony First
A2A's async-first design was crucial. Users don't expect instant results for complex tasks - they appreciate progress updates:

\`\`\`python
async def process_events_with_timeout():
    async for event in runner_generator:
        if event.is_final_response():
            final_message = event.content.parts[0].text
            logger.info("Final response received")
\`\`\`

### 2. Agent Specialization Matters
La'Kaleigh's seven-stage resume pipeline demonstrates the power of specialized agents:
- Base cleanup agent focuses only on parsing
- ATS optimization agent knows ATS algorithms
- Humanization agent makes resumes engaging
- Each does one thing well

### 3. Standardization Enables Innovation
Because we followed A2A standards, adding new features was straightforward:
\`\`\`python
# Adding a new endpoint was simple
@app.post("/tailor-resume")
async def tailor_resume(request: ResumeTailorRequest):
    # Reuse existing task manager with A2A protocol
    response = await task_manager.process_task(
        message=request.message,
        context=request.context,
        session_id=session_id
    )
\`\`\`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Application Automation**: Direct integration with job application systems
2. **Interview Preparation**: AI-powered mock interviews based on company data
3. **Success Tracking**: Monitor application outcomes to improve recommendations
4. **Multi-language Support**: Expand beyond English-speaking markets
5. **Mobile App**: Native mobile experience for on-the-go job searching

## Conclusion

The collaboration between La'Kaleigh and myself mirrors the agent collaboration in our system - each bringing specialized expertise, communicating through well-defined interfaces, and creating something more powerful together.

A2A isn't just another protocol - it's an enabler for the next generation of AI applications. By standardizing how agents communicate, it allows developers to focus on agent capabilities rather than integration plumbing. Our job search assistant is just one example of what's possible when AI agents can truly collaborate.

    content: `# Building a Real-Time Job Search MCP Server: From API to Agent with HTTP Streaming and Google ADK

*How I built and deployed a production-ready Model Context Protocol server that transforms any AI agent into a powerful job search assistant*

## The Vision: AI Agents That Actually Know About Jobs

Imagine asking an AI agent "Find me remote Python developer jobs posted this week" and getting real-time, comprehensive results including salaries, company details, and direct application links. That's exactly what I built using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) - a game-changing standard that lets AI agents securely access external tools and data sources.

In this post, I'll walk you through building a production MCP server from scratch, deploying it with HTTP streaming capabilities, and integrating it seamlessly with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## Why MCP? The Power of Extensible AI Agents

Traditional AI agents are limited to their training data, which becomes stale quickly in fast-moving domains like job markets. MCP solves this by providing a standardized way for agents to:

- **Access real-time data** through secure API connections
- **Execute actions** in external systems 
- **Maintain context** across complex multi-step workflows
- **Stream responses** for better user experience

For job search, this means agents can pull live listings, calculate current salary ranges, and even help with applications - all while maintaining the conversational interface users love.

## The Tech Stack: Modern, Scalable, Production-Ready

Here's what I chose and why:

### **FastMCP** - The Server Framework
\`\`\`python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
mcp = FastMCP(name="Job-Search")
\`\`\`

FastMCP provides a Python-native way to build MCP servers with automatic schema generation and built-in HTTP streaming support. It's perfect for rapid development while maintaining production reliability.

### **JSearch API** - The Data Source
For job data, I integrated with JSearch's comprehensive API that provides:
- Real-time job listings from major job boards
- Salary estimates and company insights
- Geographic and skills-based filtering
- Direct application links

### **Render** - Cloud Deployment
Render offers seamless deployment with automatic HTTPS, environment variable management, and scaling - perfect for MCP servers that need reliable uptime.

### **Google ADK** - Agent Framework
Google's Agent Development Kit provides the perfect counterpart to MCP servers, with native support for streaming protocols and Vertex AI integration.

## Building the MCP Server: Tools That Actually Work

The core of any MCP server is its tools. Here's how I structured the job search capabilities:

### 1. **Smart Job Search with Real-Time Filtering**
\`\`\`python
@mcp.tool()
async def search_jobs(
    query: str,
    location: str = "",
    page: int = 1,
    num_pages: int = 1,
    date_posted: str = "all",
    country: str = "us",
    employment_types: str = "",
    job_requirements: str = "",
    remote_jobs_only: bool = False
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Search for job listings with comprehensive filtering options.
    Returns detailed job information including salaries, benefits, and requirements.
    """
\`\`\`

The key insight here was making parameters flexible but not overwhelming. Instead of complex nested objects, I used simple strings that agents can easily construct.

### 2. **Comprehensive Data Formatting**
\`\`\`python
def format_job_listing(job: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Transform raw API data into agent-friendly structured information."""
    
    # Extract salary information
    salary = None
    if any([job.get("job_min_salary"), job.get("job_max_salary")]):
        salary = {
            "min": job.get("job_min_salary"),
            "max": job.get("job_max_salary"),
            "currency": job.get("job_salary_currency"),
            "period": job.get("job_salary_period")
        }

    # Structure highlights for easy agent consumption
    highlights = job.get("job_highlights", {})
    
    return {
        "job_id": job.get("job_id"),
        "job_title": job.get("job_title"),
        "company_name": job.get("employer_name"),
        "location": job.get("job_location"),
        "employment_type": job.get("job_employment_type"),
        "remote": job.get("job_is_remote", False),
        "salary": salary,
        "qualifications": highlights.get("Qualifications", []),
        "responsibilities": highlights.get("Responsibilities", []),
        "benefits": highlights.get("Benefits", []),
        "apply_link": job.get("job_apply_link"),
        # ... more structured fields
    }
\`\`\`

This formatting layer is crucial - it transforms messy API responses into clean, consistent data that agents can reliably work with.

### 3. **Multiple Search Strategies**
I implemented five complementary tools:
- \`search_jobs\` - General job search with filters
- \`get_job_details\` - Deep dive into specific positions
- \`search_jobs_by_company\` - Company-focused searches
- \`get_salary_estimate\` - Market rate analysis
- \`get_company_salary\` - Company-specific compensation data

## Deployment: HTTP Streaming in Production

### The Render Configuration
\`\`\`python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(
        transport="streamable-http",
        host="0.0.0.0", 
        port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8000)), 
        path="/jobsearch-mcp",
        log_level="debug"
    )
\`\`\`

The magic is in that \`transport="streamable-http"\` parameter. This enables:
- **Real-time streaming** of responses as they're generated
- **Connection persistence** for better performance
- **Error resilience** with automatic reconnection
- **Scalable architecture** that handles multiple concurrent agents

### Environment Setup
\`\`\`bash
# .env file
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_jsearch_api_key
PORT=8000
\`\`\`

Render automatically injects the PORT variable and handles SSL termination, making deployment surprisingly simple.

## Google ADK Integration: Where the Magic Happens

### The Agent Configuration
\`\`\`python
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset import MCPToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StreamableHTTPServerParams

root_agent = LlmAgent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash-001',
    name='job_search_assistant',
    instruction='''You are a helpful job search assistant with access to real-time job data.
    
    Available tools:
    - search_jobs: Find current job listings with detailed filters
    - get_job_details: Get comprehensive information about specific positions
    - search_jobs_by_company: Explore opportunities at specific companies
    - get_salary_estimate: Research market rates for positions
    - get_company_salary: Get company-specific compensation data
    
    Always provide helpful, detailed responses with specific job information.''',
    tools=[
        MCPToolset(
            connection_params=StreamableHTTPServerParams(
                url='https://gethired-mcp.onrender.com/jobsearch-mcp',
            ),
        )
    ],
)
\`\`\`

### The Streaming Experience
\`\`\`python
# The ADK automatically handles streaming responses
async for event in runner.run_async(session_id=session.id, user_id=user_id, new_message=content):
    if hasattr(event, 'message') and event.message:
        print(event.message)  # Real-time updates as agent processes
\`\`\`

What makes this powerful is the seamless integration. The agent automatically:
- Discovers available tools from the MCP server
- Validates function schemas against Vertex AI requirements
- Streams tool execution results back to users in real-time
- Maintains conversation context across multiple tool calls

## The Challenge: Schema Compatibility

### The Problem
During integration, I hit a wall with Vertex AI's function calling requirements:

\`\`\`
400 INVALID_ARGUMENT: Unable to submit request because \`search_jobs\` 
functionDeclaration \`parameters.employment_types\` schema specified 
other fields alongside any_of. When using any_of, it must be the only field set.
\`\`\`

### The Solution
FastMCP was generating schemas with conflicting \`any_of\` and \`type\` fields for optional parameters:

\`\`\`python
# ❌ This caused schema conflicts:
employment_types: Optional[str] = None

# ✅ This works perfectly:
employment_types: str = ""
\`\`\`

The fix was simple but crucial - use empty strings instead of None for optional parameters, then handle them in the logic:

\`\`\`python
if employment_types.strip():
    api_params["employment_types"] = employment_types
\`\`\`

## Results: A Production-Ready Job Search Agent

The final system delivers:

### **Real-Time Job Discovery**
\`\`\`
User: "Find remote Python developer jobs posted this week"
Agent: *Uses search_jobs with filters*
       "I found 47 remote Python developer positions posted in the last 7 days..."
\`\`\`

### **Intelligent Salary Research**
\`\`\`
User: "What do data scientists make at Google?"
Agent: *Uses get_company_salary*
       "Based on current market data, Data Scientists at Google earn..."
\`\`\`

### **Multi-Step Job Analysis**
\`\`\`
User: "Compare software engineer roles at startups vs big tech"
Agent: *Uses multiple tools to gather comprehensive data*
       "Here's a detailed comparison based on current listings..."
\`\`\`

## Performance and Scalability

The HTTP streaming architecture delivers:
- **Sub-second response times** for initial tool calls
- **Progressive result streaming** for large datasets
- **Reliable error handling** with automatic retries
- **Horizontal scalability** on Render's infrastructure

## Lessons Learned and Best Practices

### 1. **Design for Agent Consumption**
Structure your tool responses with agents in mind. Clear, consistent schemas beat flexibility for AI consumption.

### 2. **Embrace HTTP Streaming**
The streaming transport makes a huge difference in perceived performance, especially for data-heavy operations.

### 3. **Schema Validation is Critical**
Test your function schemas thoroughly against your target LLM providers. Small incompatibilities can break entire integrations.

### 4. **Error Handling Wins**
Robust error handling and fallback responses keep agents functional even when external APIs have issues.

### 5. **Environment Management**
Use proper environment variable management from day one. It makes deployment and scaling much smoother.

## What's Next: The Future of MCP

This job search server is just the beginning. The MCP ecosystem is rapidly evolving with:

- **Multi-modal capabilities** for processing resumes and job descriptions
- **Integration with ATS systems** for direct applications
- **Personal career tracking** with persistent state management
- **Company research tools** with real-time market data

The combination of MCP servers, HTTP streaming, and modern agent frameworks like Google ADK is creating a new category of AI applications that are both powerful and reliable.

## Get Started Today

Want to build your own MCP server? Here's your starting checklist:

1. **Choose your domain** - What external data/APIs would make your agents more useful?
2. **Set up FastMCP** - Get the development environment running locally
3. **Design your tools** - Think from the agent's perspective, not the user's
4. **Test the schemas** - Validate against your target LLM early and often
5. **Deploy with streaming** - Use the streamable-http transport for production
6. **Integrate with ADK** - Connect to Google's agent framework for the full experience

The future of AI is agents that can act in the real world. MCP servers are the bridge that makes it possible.
